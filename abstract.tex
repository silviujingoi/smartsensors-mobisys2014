\subsection*{Abstract}
 
  Applications that perform continuous sensing on mobile phones have
  the potential to revolutionize everyday life.  Examples range from
  medical and health monitoring applications, such as pedometers and
  fall detectors, to participatory sensing applications, such as
  pollution and traffic monitoring.  Unfortunately, current mobile
  devices are a poor match for continuous sensing applications as they
  require the device to remain awake for extended periods of time,
  causing fast battery drainage.  This paper presents {\em
  Smartsensors}\/, a new approach that offloads the periodic sensing
  portion of the continuous sensing application to a low power
  processor and wakes up the main processor only when an event of
  interest occurs.  Smartsensors differ from other heterogeneous
  architectures in that developers are presented with a programming
  interface that lets them define application specific wake up
  conditions by selecting among a set of predefined filtering
  algorithms and tuning their parameters.  Smartsensors achieve
  performance that is comparable to approaches that provide fully
  programmable offloading, but do so with a much simpler programming
  interface that simplifies deployment and portability.
