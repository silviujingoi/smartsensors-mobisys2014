Octopus is a framework for data intensive computing on virtualized
datacenters. Octopus is optimized for scenarios where datasets are
reused by multiple applications or by multiple queries run by the same
application.  Under these conditions, Octopus reduces network usage,
lowers file system load, and decreases application runtimes through
on-machine file caching, cross-VM file sharing, and data-aware job
scheduling.
