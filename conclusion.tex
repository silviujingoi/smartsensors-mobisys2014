\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Describe the benefits of wake-up conditions and batching individually
Expect even higher energy savings by combining batching with wake-up conditions

don't wake-up for "uninteresting" batches
sleep intervals during continuous interesting events without any effect on recall
Batching and multiapp optimizations are complementary (preserve accuracy)
Identify more opportunities for mult-iapplication optimizations
