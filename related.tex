Over the past few years there has been a significant amount of work on reducing energy consumption in mobile devices. Reflex~\cite{reflex} achieves energy efficiency by leveraging architectural asymmetry between two low-power processors and a powerful central processor. However, an application developer has to be aware of the heterogeneous nature of these platforms and even simple applications have to be refactored into distributed programs. The programmer has to divide the application into separate modules what run on the central and peripheral processors, respectively. Turducken~\cite{turducken} is a mobile device architecture that integrates several mobile computing platforms that operate at different power levels into a multi-tiered device. The authors present two options available to developers in order to create distributed applications. One option is to ``use a proxy-based architecture that can take advantage of existing distributed application components''. Alternatively, the developer has to build an application that is customized for the system, by creating components for each tier. Smart Sensors differs from these approaches by hiding the heterogeneous nature of our system from the application developer. Creating an application that makes use of one or more Smart Sensors does not require the developer to create any code that will run on the low-power processor.

Little Rock~\cite{littlerock} proposes a system architecture similar to ours in order to run a basic Pedometer application. The paper presents two approaches to reducing energy consumption. In the first approach, the entire Pedometer application is executed on the low-power processor, achieving significant power savings. This is possible because their implementation of the pedometer application only performs several algebraic and comparison operations for each accelerometer reading, hence it can run on the peripheral processor in real-time. The Steps application we implemented for our evaluation uses a more complex algorithm, including Discrete Fourier Transforms and Inverse Discrete Fourier Transforms. In the second approach, they propose a hybrid application, where the low-power processor is responsible for acquiring sensor readings, waking up the main processor, transferring the data and letting the phone perform all the processing. This approach is similar to the Batching method described in our paper and suffers from the same drawbacks. The power profile of their hybrid implementation is similar to our results for the Batching method. Similarly to Reflex and Turducken, Little Rock's heterogeneous architecture makes application development more complex. Smart Sensors is complementary to these works by introducing a programming model based on customizable data filters and wake-up conditions that simplifies application development while taking advantage of the power savings realized by the use of a low-power processor.

Ace~\cite{ace} is a middleware that supports continuous context-aware applications while mitigating sensing cost for acquisition of context attributes (such as AtHome and IsDriving). It can achieve power savings when context attributes are requested by multiple applications and there exists a strong correlation between the values of these context attributes. Additionally, it can reduce power consumption when a ``cheaper'' sensor exists, which can determine the value of a different context attribute that has a strong correlation with the requested context attribute (e.g. use the accelerometer to check if the user is jogging instead of using the GPS to determine if the user is at work). A middleware such as Ace is a great example of a library that can run on top of a Smart Sensors architecture (once we implement support for sensors other than the accelerometer) and achieve additional power savings.
